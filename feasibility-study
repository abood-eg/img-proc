    abstract 
    
    -health tracking web application is an effictive methods to keep you healthy , this application contains a database of almost all the food
  and the calories that you will happen to eat , you can creat an account provide the application with your info then the app will help you
  track your calories and your weight help you be in a healthy body ,this application is needed by all ages men or women ,health tracking
  application allow you to choose your meals and calculate the calories in the meal you eat ,contains a list of food to choose from *like a     
  menu *,the app will evaluate your performance ,the amount of weight you lost and how far you need to go .
    
 Objectives:

    ● Provide an easy way to manange your everyday meals.
    ● Count calories and keep track of weight loss process.
    ● Easy to use, access from anywhere.
    ● Build beautiful profile with progress.
   
    
  the need for the project :
  
    it is hard to lose weight with this amount of resturants arround you ,it's hard to know how much weight you gained how much calories you have
     burnt ,this app provide a simple solution .
    it's needed by :
    - athelets and players
    - elder with diabetes and cholestrol
    - women 
    - the public in genral
    
   Existing Systems And Tech :
   
   an example of this application is the famous web application myfitnesspal . this application contains some of the ideas we are using in health
    tracking app ,although this application is more concerned with your health and body status 
       
 
 Tools and Resources

    - HTML/CSS for Frontend
    - JS for backend
    - MongoDB or MySQL 
    - Some API to fetch nutrition facts
    - more might be added later
   
   
 scope of the project 
    
        main actors of the system 
         
        - the user of the app 
        - the food & the calories     
        
        
        the user of the app
        
        * create an account
        * enter some info to help us track his status 
        * choose the food with a reasonable amount of calories
        * be straight with himself
        
        the food & the calories 
        
        * each ingrediant contains a nomber of calories
        * counter count the no-of-calories per day 
    
    
    
    deliverables
      
       web based software application that contains a central database .
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
 Feasibility study
   
    financial feasibility :
    
    since it is a web application and a pounch of studens are designing it no cost for the staff 
    the application will follow the freeware software standards, low bandwidth is required
   all the initial stages will be free abviously 
   -at first we will choose some of related friends and family test the app give us feedbacks 
   then next stage we will widen the circle of the clints and when it is decided that the application is ready for 
   the ordinary user to use we are announcing the application to the public 
   
   from that the project is financially feasible
    
    
    technical feasibility
     - HTML/CSS for Frontend
     - JS for backend
     - MongoDB or MySQL 
     - Some API to fetch nutrition facts
     - visual studio code 
     - git\githup
     - we expect more 
     
     all these technologies are free 
     
      
       
    
Resources feasibility

   - programming devices *laptops*
   - hosting space 
   - programming tools 
   - programmers 
   
   
Risk feasibility :
    size as a lot of progrmmers are depositing in this web application the size might be a broblem
    hopefully the size of the project is not beyond 200mb .
    -size of the database will not exceed 625526 entries per table
   
    time as the project is big and the background of the programmers working on the project is limmited 
    so we will try the best we could to finish this project on time
      
      
Users of the project ::
    
    the puplic (everyone)
    
    developers 
        
    
    
    
    
    
 considerations 
  
  performance
  
  the increasing of the number of users will not affect the performance
  no big analysis is done on the data of the database so the speed is not affected as well
  but since we will use an api to bring the food database the internet speed might slow the user if his connection is poor
  other then that ,it will take less than 2 seconds to process and respond
  
  query and reporting time :not yet
  throughput : not yet  
  storage : not yet
  
  
  
  security
  
  authentication is required for each user 
  each user will have a user name and a password 
  and each user will have authorization to his account only 
  the user activity will be recorded *only for safety*
  
  
  
  availablity 
   
   the system will be available as long as you have an internet connection
   
   
   
   maintability
   
   in this application the engineers uses thir background of oop and rup to design this web application
   ,the application is well structured and designed to simulate a very famous website
